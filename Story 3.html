<h2>The years between 2020 and 2024 were a whirlwind of connections for me. I made a lot of friends or at least, that’s what I thought they were. But in a crowded room, I knew none of them would pick me out of the crowd. I was just there, trailing behind them like a shadow, unnoticed and unimportant.</h2>

<h2>Sometimes, I’d catch myself watching them. They’d laugh, help each other out, share their moments of joy and struggles, while I sat on the sidelines, feeling invisible. I wished, just once, that someone would notice me too. It wasn’t like I never needed help, I did. But asking for it felt like screaming into the void, knowing no one would hear.</h2>

<h2>When the weight of it all became too much, I’d retreat to a corner, hoping someone might notice the silence I carried. But no one ever did. They were too busy, too preoccupied with their own lives. I couldn’t blame them, though. Who was I, really? Just someone they saw but never truly looked at.</h2>

<h2>In those quiet moments, music became my only friend. It wrapped around me like a warm embrace, drowning out the noise and the ache. With each note, the world faded away, and for a while, I could forget. Forget the loneliness, the jealousy, and the lingering question that haunted me: Was I really overthinking, or was this just how things were meant to be?</h2>

<h2>Since those years, 2020 to 2024, I’ve developed a quiet ritual for the days when sadness feels too heavy. I retreat to my bedroom, close the door, and let the world outside fade away. With a simple flick, I turn off the lights, letting the darkness embrace me. Then, I lie on my bed, staring into the void or closing my eyes, hoping the stillness will somehow ease the ache in my chest. It’s not much, but in those moments, it feels like the only place where I can truly let go and just exist.</h2>
