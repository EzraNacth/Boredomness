<h2>It was a time I don't often like to revisit, but the memories linger like an old photo tucked away in a dusty corner. Back then, a lot happened—too much, really—but one thing stands out and makes my chest ache a little: everyone seemed to have their own friends. I’d sit in the corner of the room, watching them laugh and talk, feeling like a spectator in a play I didn’t audition for.</h2> 

<h2>I thought of myself as the weirdo, the odd one out. And to be honest, I wasn’t wrong. Thinking back on it now, I can’t help but cringe. The things I did, the way I acted—I’d rather not remember. Yet, here I am, shaking my head at my younger self. I mean, what else could I do but laugh it off?</h2>

<h2>In those moments, all I wanted was for the day to end so I could go home, bury myself in my own little world, and have my kind of fun. Back then, I didn’t really understand what it meant to be alone. The idea didn’t even cross my mind. It was just how things were, and it felt... fine, I guess.</h2>

<h2>But now, looking back, I see it differently. I was alone. Always. And yet, it didn’t bother me. I accepted it, shrugged it off like an old coat I was used to wearing. After all, being on my own was never really the problem. If anything, it was the only thing that ever felt natural to me.</h2>
