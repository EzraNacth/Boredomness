        <li>
            <h3>"When you realize you've never been put first your whole life.
            You're just the person who fills a void in people's lives until they don't need you anymore."</h3></li>
        <li><h3>"I have a lot of friends but not a single one of them would pick me in a room full of people."</h3></li>
        <li><h3>"The saddest thing about betrayal is that it never comes from your enemies."</h3></li>
        <li><h3>"The seats are empty. The theatre is dark. Why do you keep acting?"</h3></li>
        <li><h3>"I didn't change. I just started treating people the way they treat me."</h3></li>
        <li><h3>"How can I blame the wind for making a mess when I'm the one who opened the window?"</h3></li>
        <li><h3>"Everyone else has their own friends, and I'm just there following and watching them like a shadow."</h3></li>
    </ul>
