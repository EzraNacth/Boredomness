<h2>Story 1</h2>
<h3>Being alone is...
like walking on an empty road,
no one to talk to, no one to lean on,
but it’s where you find yourself—
your thoughts, your strength,
and the peace you didn’t know you needed.</h3>

<h2>Story 2 and 3</h2>
<h3>Sometimes i realize that everyone has a life of their own. Problems you have no idea about, joys, and pains you will never be aware of.
Everyone is living their own story while you're trying to live yours. Isn't that crazy??</h3>
